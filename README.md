p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="9">ou must find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.<br> The board is represented by a file passed as the program’s argument. The file is valid if it is respecting those constraints:<br> • its first line contains the number of lines on the board (andonlythat),<br> • “.”(representing an empty place) and “o” (representing an obstacle) are the only two characters for the other lines,<br> • all of the line sare of the same length (exceptthefirstone),<br> • it contains at least one line,<br> • each line is terminated by ‘\n’.<br> You program must print the board, with some “.” replaced by “x” to represent the largest square you found.<br> If ever there are several solutions, you have to represent only the highest square. If they are still several solutions, choose the square to the left</p>
